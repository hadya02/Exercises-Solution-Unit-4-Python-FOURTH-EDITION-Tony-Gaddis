 Tuition Increase
At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is $8,000 per semester. It has been announced
that the tuition will increase by 3 percent each year for the next 5 years. Write a program
with a loop that displays the projected semester tuition amount for the next 5 years.

print("semmester\ttuition")
print('----------')
semester_tuition=8000
for semester in range(1,11):
 percentage=(8000*3)/100
 if 1<=semester <=2:
  tuition=semester_tuition+(1*percentage)
  print(semester,'\t',tuition)
 elif 3<=semester<=4:
  tuition=semester_tuition+(2*percentage)
  print(semester,'\t',tuition)
 elif 5<=semester<=6:
  tuition=semester_tuition+(3*percentage)
