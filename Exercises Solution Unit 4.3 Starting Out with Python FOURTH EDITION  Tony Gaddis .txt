Lap Times
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of times that they have run around
a racetrack, and then uses a loop to prompt them to enter the lap time for each of their laps.
When the loop finishes, the program should display the time of their fastest lap, the time of
their slowest lap, and their average lap time.



number_of_time=int(input("enter the number of time :"))
round=1
while_of_round<=3
     each_round=number_of_time*round
     round+=1 
if round>number_of_time:
  print("fast")
elif round<number_of_time:
  print("slow")
else:
  print("average")

i=
time_race=3
while i<=time_race:
 laps=int(input("enter the time of the laps:"))
 if laps1<laps:
    print("fastest")
 elif laps1>laps:
    print("slowlest")
 else:
    print("averagr")
