Sleep Debt
A “sleep debt” represents the difference between a person’s desirable and actual amount
of sleep. Write a program that prompts the user to enter how many hours they slept each
day over a period of seven days. Using 8 hours per day as the desirable amount of sleep,
determine their sleep debt by calculating the total hours of sleep they got over the seven-day
period and subtracting that from the total hours of sleep they should have got. If the user
does not have a sleep debt, display a message expressing your jealousy.

desirable_amo=8
day=7
total=0
sleep=int(input('how many hours do you sleep?:'))
for i in rangr(day):
  if total>=0:
  desirable=day*desirale_amo
  total=total+sleep
  sub=desirable_total
print("hi")
