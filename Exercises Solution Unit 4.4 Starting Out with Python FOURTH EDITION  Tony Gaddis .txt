 Distance Traveled
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
distance 5 speed 3 time
For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance traveled is
120 miles. Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour)
and the number of hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the distance
the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the desired
output:
What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40 Enter
How many hours has it traveled? 3 Enter
Hour Distance Traveled
1 40
2 80
3 120


distance=0
speed=int(input("enter the speed:"))
hours=int(input("enter the hours you have traveled:"))
hour=1
while hour<=hours:
    distance=hour*speed
    print(str(hour),"    ",str(distance),end="\t")
    print("\n")
    hour+=1
