Calories Burned
Running on a particular treadmill you burn 4.2 calories per minute. Write a program that
uses a loop to display the number of calories burned after 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.

burn_collories=4.2
munite=10
while munite<=30:
        collories=burn_collories*munite
        munite+=5 
        print(collories)
