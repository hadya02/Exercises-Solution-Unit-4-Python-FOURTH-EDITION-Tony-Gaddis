 Calculating the Factorial of a Number
In mathematics, the notation n! represents the factorial of the nonnegative integer n. The
factorial of n is the product of all the nonnegative integers from 1 to n. For example,
7! 5 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 5 5,040
and
 4! 5 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 5 24
Write a program that lets the user enter a nonnegative integer then uses a loop to calculate
the factorial of that number. Display the factorial.

fac=1
num=int(input("enter the number:"))
for i in range(1,num+1):
  fac=fac*i
print('factoria is' , fac)
